### Description

![USAGE](bonus/assets/images/usage.png)

The program must print :
- The velocity vector of the ball
- The coordinates of the ball after a time shift n
- The angle at which the ball will hit the paddle (if it will actually hit it, at anytime from t = 0).

### Grade

Marvin couldn't find our unit tests.
Only the case when the incidence angle was equal to zero was not treated.

### Bonus

There is a complete 2D Pong made in pygame as a bonus located in the bonus directory :
